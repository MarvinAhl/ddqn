1. Run:
250: path not optimal but stable!
500: very aggressive but also stable        Winner!
750: worse, slidy and not that stable
1000: godaweful

2. Run:
250: also very aggressive and looking pretty good
500: even more aggressive and a bit unstable at times
750: I wouldnt want to fly in that one but seems to be good
1000 is just too much ...

3. Run:
250: off to the moon it goes! Wait ...
500: Hovering but doesnt really have the courage to actually land, funniest one by far
750: very good compared to its predecessors but landing is a bit rough sometimes
1000: like 500 but a bit more aggressive

Seems like epsilon greedy is actually better than softmax under these circumstances

Hidden Layers = (1000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 1000)
