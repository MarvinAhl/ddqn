Earlier reward function of rewarding every parameter independently didn't work
out at all because zero rotation is when your nose is pointing downwards. That's
why I started rewarding landing successfully as a whole and then just adding
gaussian terms to perfect it.

Too much fuel punishement is also bad because it will just do nothing anymore.
Added some slight rewards for x- and y-velocities at tuchdown to guide learning

It's always doing nothing but that's actually super stupid in my opinion.
It even encountered some good landings by accident, why isn't it going for those?
I think the complexity of the game might be too high so I will reduce how far
off to the left and right the rocket can spawn
