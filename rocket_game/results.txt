Earlier reward function of rewarding every parameter independently didn't work
out at all because zero rotation is when your nose is pointing downwards. That's
why I started rewarding landing successfully as a whole and then just adding
gaussian terms to perfect it.

Too much fuel punishement is also bad because it will just do nothing anymore.
